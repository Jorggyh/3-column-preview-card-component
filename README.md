## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I was able to practice the `clamp()` function, considering that the challenge contains a mobile and a
desktop design, I was able to adapt the desktop design for tablets using `clamp()`, a good alternative to not
having to create several media queries.
